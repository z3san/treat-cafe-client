              <p>Uncontrolled components in React are form elements whose values are managed by the DOM. Controlled components, on the other hand, have their values managed by React state. The key difference is that with uncontrolled components, the user input is directly reflected in the DOM, whereas with controlled components, the state must be updated with the new value, which then updates the DOM.</p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Validating React Props with PropTypes</h2>
              <p>PropTypes is a built-in library in React that allows you to validate the types of your component props. You can use PropTypes to ensure that the props passed to your component are of the correct type, or to provide default values for props that aren't required. This can help catch errors early on and make your code more robust and maintainable.</p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Node.js vs Express.js</h2>
              <p>Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. It allows you to build scalable and fast applications using JavaScript. Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for building web applications. It provides a set of features for handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, and middleware that makes it easy to build complex applications.</p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Custom Hooks in React</h2>
              <p>A custom hook is a function that allows you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components in a React application. Custom hooks are useful for abstracting complex logic into reusable, easy-to-understand functions. For example, you might create a custom hook to handle form validation, or to fetch data from an API. Custom hooks are created using the useState and useEffect hooks, and can be used just like any other hook in React.</p>
